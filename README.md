# MiniNeroDroid
A convenience-oriented Monero phone wallet for Android. 

This is currently functional, although a couple of features, which exist in the windows version, still have yet to be implemented.  
If you want to beta test it, you can clone the repo and open it in Android Studio 1.5.1, just put your mininodo ip / key in the settings menu. (Requires MiniNodo.js to work: https://github.com/shennoether/mininodo )

####Features:####
* Bitcoin / Xmr uri and qr scanning support
* Send to xmr addresses directly or to bitcoin addresses via xmr.to
* Save / Load / Delete addresses in the small address book 
* Nacl Authentication between the app and your Monero Server
* View past transactions with links to various block-explorers

####Still to do:####
* Add Nacl Encryption support (currently only https)
* Password support
* Toggle for Dark / Light Theme
* Submit to Play Store (or maybe another repo)

This app requires MiniNodo server running on the same box as your Monero installation:

This should eventually be feature equivalent to the existing windows universal app version:
